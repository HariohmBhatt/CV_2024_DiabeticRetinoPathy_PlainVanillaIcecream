# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Project

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for a Computer Vision project focused on Diabetic Retinopathy detection. The project aims to develop an automated system for detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy from retinal images.

## Project Structure

- `Weekly Reports/`: Contains detailed weekly progress reports documenting the development process
  - CV_Weekly_Report_1.pdf through CV_Weekly_Report_7.pdf
- `Mid-Semester Reports/`: Contains mid-semester evaluation and progress reports
- `Simple_plain_Vanila_Icecream_Project_Report.pdf`: Final project report detailing the complete implementation and results

## Project Overview

This project implements a computer vision system for automated detection of diabetic retinopathy, a diabetes complication that affects the eyes. The system uses deep learning and image processing techniques to analyze retinal images and classify them according to the severity of the condition.
